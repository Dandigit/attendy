## FAQ
### What does Attendy do, exactly?
Attendy uses RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to mark attendance and/or sign out. It sycs data stored on the cards as well as other useful information straight to Google Sheets. RFID is great because tags can be put in almost anything, from a card to a sticker to a hat. It's a very quick and hassle-free way to identify someone.

### What hardware does it support?
Right now Attendy runs on the Raspberry Pi B+, 2 or 3 connected to the RC522 board. You can find RC522's on eBay for about $10 AUD that are bundled with some RFID tags and cards.

### Can I use this code in my projects?
Well, I've put it under the MIT license, so feel free to do so. I'm pretty sure you need to include a copyright notice found in the LICENSE file, but other than that, you're free to make something cool.
