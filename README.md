# Attendy
Attendy is a Raspberry Pi based RFID attendance system. It includes tools and libraries that make setup a breeze.

## FAQ
### What does Attendy do, exactly?
Attendy uses RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to mark attendance and/or sign out. RFID is great because tags can be put in almost anything, from a card to a sticker to a hat. It's also a very quick and hassle-free way to identify someone.

### What hardware does it support?
Right now Attendy runs on the Raspberry Pi B+, 2 or 3 connected to the RC522 board. You can find RC522's on eBay for about $10 AUD that are bundled with some RFID tags and cards.
